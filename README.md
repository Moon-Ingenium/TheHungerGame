# The Hunger Game

## User Story:
As a busy consumer
I want a simple diet-friendly recipe generator
So that it will randomly generate a recipe, then add ingredients to my cart and search for the nearest grocery store.

## Acceptance Criteria:
GIVEN I am generating a random recipe based off restrictions
WHEN I get on the app I can select dietary restrictions
Then I can choose breakfast, lunch, or dinner
WHEN I click a meal option
THEN I am presented with an image, recipe and ingredient list
WHEN I click ingredients
THEN I can add items to my shopping list
WHEN I click next
THEN I will be forwarded to a new recipe in that category
WHEN I type my zip code
THEN I can find the one nearest grocery store to me
